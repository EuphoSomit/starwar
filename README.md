This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Create a React application having two screens with proper navigation. You will be using API from the website http://swapi.co. Please go through the documentation of the swapi website and understand the API response carefully to choose the right set of APIs and call them with the proper arguments. The application is supposed to have 2 screens: 

SCREEN 1 (Login Screen) 
Allow the user to login as a character from STAR WARS using the character name as the username and birth year as the password. 
Example: 
• Username: Luke Skywalker 
• Password : 19BBY 

SCREEN 2 (Search Screen) 
Implement a type-along search which searches for planets and lists them in components that are sized relative to their population on every keypress in the input field. (eg: you can use a bigger font size for a planet with larger population, or even show a bigger container size for a planet with larger population - we would like to see your creativity). On clicking the item from the results of the type-along search, it should display the corresponding planet information. 
You also need to provide the relevant Logout flow properly in your application. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn install`

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
